### Hi there üëã
  - üòä I am Bilal Hamza, an enthusiastic software engineering undergraduate.
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è A passionate individual thrilled and excited about the life-changing power of the IT industry and what its technologies has in offer for me.

    My journey in software engineering has been driven by the want of creating effective solutions for real-world problems. Currently pursuing my degree in software engineering at the National Institute of Business Management Colombo, I have had       the opportunity to work on a diverse range of coursework, from data structures and algorithms to web development using various programming languages like java, JavaScript, and python basics. Additionally I am also educated in web development       technologies such as HTML and CSS. These experiences have provided me a secure base and a thirst for knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
    Outside of my academic achievements, I am known to my dedication, commitment and adaptability when it comes to teamwork. I am eager to continue enhancing my skills exploring new technologies and make a meaningful difference in this                 digitalizing world. What other things do I love other than software engineering? I'd say football and gaming:)

    So, that's it about me and if you'd like to connect or collaborate, please feel free to reach out. Let's build the future together!
